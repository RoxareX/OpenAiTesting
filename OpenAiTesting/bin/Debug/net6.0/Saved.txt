Once upon a time there was a magical kingdom where the sun always shone and the birds always sang. The people were happy and content. One day, a wicked witch cast a spell on the kingdom, and everything went dark. The sun disappeared, the birds stopped singing, and the people were all very sad. One brave knight decided to go on a quest to find the sun and bring it back to the kingdom. After many challenges, he finally found the sun and destroyed the witch's spell. The kingdom was saved, and everyone lived happily ever after.)
