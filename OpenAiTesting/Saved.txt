Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess who lived in a castle with her loving parents. One day, a wicked witch cast a spell on the princess, turning her into a frog. The princess was very sad and wished she could be human again. One day, a kind prince came along and kissed her, breaking the spell. The princess turned back into a beautiful woman and they lived happily ever after.)
